Here is my calculator web app using Java. I have made it to act like a simple calculator. It is designed in a MVC structural, loosely connected by Spring Boot framework. It includes 2 objects that are in the local machine’s memory: the current input and running total. With parsing from String to Double and vice versa, it can deal with input and maths errors that can occur with an error message. Otherwise, it will compute operations accurately up to 14 s.f. I used Thymeleaf for server-side rendering and edited Html and CSS files from cssacademy.com and w3schools for the frontend.
